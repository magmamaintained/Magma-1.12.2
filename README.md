## ‚ùì About 

Magma is the next generation of hybrid minecraft server softwares.

Magma is based on **Forge and Paper**, meaning it can run both **Craftbukkit/Spigot/Paper plugins and Forge mods**.

We hope to eliminate all issues with craftbukkit forge servers. In the end, we envision a seamless, low lag Magma experience with support for newer 1.12+ versions of Minecraft.

## ‚òïÔ∏è Java 8
Magma for 1.12.2 <b>requires Java 8</b>. Java 9 or higher do <b>not</b> work due to Forge 1.12.2.

If you need a higher version of Java for other applications, you can install both versions and use `"<path to java.exe>" -jar magma.jar` instead of `java -jar magma.jar`.

## üåê BungeeCord/Velocity

Magma is compatible with [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/downloads), but it does not support modern forwarding.

If you want to use Magma in a BungeeCord network, we recommend to use [Waterfall](https://github.com/PaperMC/Waterfall)/[Travertine](https://github.com/PaperMC/Travertine) or [HexaCord](https://github.com/HexagonMC/BungeeCord) instead since it has better Forge support than BungeeCord.

In order to use Magma with BungeeCord, you have to enable `forge-support` in the BungeeCord config, set `online-mode` to false in server.properties and `bungeecord` to true in spigot.yml.

Magma for Minecraft 1.16 and above can be found in their own repositories.
