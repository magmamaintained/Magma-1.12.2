### What's Magma?

Magma next  generation in hybrid servers.

Magma is based on Forge and Paper builds, meaning it can run both Craftbukkit/Spigot/Paper-based plugins and forge-based mods.

We hope to eliminate all issues with craftbukkit forge servers. In the end, we envision a seamless, low lag Magma experience with support for new 1.12+ versions of Minecraft.
